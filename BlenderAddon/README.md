# Blender Add-on for Photon-v2

[//TODO]: # (add a tutorial on how to install)

The folder named `PhotonBlend` is a Blender add-on for Photon. **We support only Blender 2.80 and higher**. Please follow standard Blender add-on installation procedure to install it.

[//TODO]: # (simple tutorials on how to use the addon)

## Features

* Exporting scenes to Photon's scene description format
* Manipulating materials implemented in Photon with shader nodes
* Physically meaningful input parameters

## Contributing

* It can be useful to have [fake bpy modules](https://github.com/nutti/fake-bpy-module) around so that `import bpy` and its equivalent no longer trigger errors in your IDE (and autocomplete is now possible).

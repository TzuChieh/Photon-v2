@brief Low-level rendering infrastructure.

GHI (Graphics Hardware Interface) related functionalities may need to be executed from a dedicated thread 
(never assume main thread or render thread is where they can be executed). One exception is that classes
prefixed with "GHIInfo" are for passing information around and is safe to be stored and used everywhere.

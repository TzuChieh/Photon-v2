@brief Low-level rendering infrastructure.

GHI (Graphics Hardware Interface) related functionalities may need to be executed from a dedicated thread 
(never assume main thread or render thread is where they can be executed), with some exceptions:

* GHI enum types
* Classes prefixed with "GHIInfo"

These GHI types are for passing information around and is safe to be stored and used everywhere.

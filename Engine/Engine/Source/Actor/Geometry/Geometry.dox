/*! @dir Geometry
@brief Defines basic shapes.

A standalone data container.

If there is a ball in the scene, we can create a spherical geometry to represent
its shape; if there is a piece of paper on the table, we can use a rectanguler
geometry to model it. Geometries are the barebone of a scene: materials, lights,
physical motionsâ€¦ are all built on top of geometries. They are basically the
heart of a virtual world.

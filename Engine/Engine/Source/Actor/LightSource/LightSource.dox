@brief Defines energy emitting entities.

A standalone data container.

Without energy sources, you simply cannot take a picture of the scene. Light
sources are essential for defining behaviors of radiant energy emission. Here I
distinguish model and area sources by their emission profile: area sources have
constant emission across its defined surface; whereas model sources are more
general and allow texture mapped emission along with arbitrary geometry.

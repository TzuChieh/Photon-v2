/*! @dir Frame
@brief Image data manipulation.

In this folder, there are basically two categories of image data, frame and picture. There is a subtle
difference between them. Generally, frame is a memory block that holds arbitrary data (typically image data),
and picture is for common image data specifically (e.g., usual image files like a camera photo).
Photon distinguish frame and picture so implementation can make more assumptions when dealing with pictures,
which simplifies the logic for many cases. Though pictures are less flexible, they can be more memory
efficient as their internal data is begin kept as close to their storage form (i.e., on disk) as possible.

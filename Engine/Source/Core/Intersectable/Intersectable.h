/*! @brief An object in the scene that a ray can intersect with.

To construct a scene, we must populate it with some *objects*. Imagining you are
beside a table with a mug on it, how would you describe the shape of those two
objects? Specifically, how to represent them digitally in a computer? One way to
do this is to model them using many triangles or quads. Take a triangle for
example, in a renderer like Photon, simply store the three vertices of it is not
enough: we need to support opearations on the stored data for it to be useful,
this is what intersectables are meant for.

The most common operation is **ray intersection test**. We need to know whether
a given ray is intersecting a triangle for the rest of the system to work.
Remember that we can also model the table and mug using other shapes such as
quads, they should support the same operation set as triangles. Photon supports
many kinds of *object* that can be intersected by rays, such as just-mentioned
triangles and quads, and they are named after their capability "intersectable".

# About This Directory

Contains various items for the project itself.

## Render Test

`./RenderTest/` is the project's primary end-to-end tests. It has its own README with more in-depth introduction.

## Documentation

`./Documentation/` holds the main documentation for the project, and we are using jothepro's [doxygen-awesome-css](https://github.com/jothepro/doxygen-awesome-css) for customization (note that we also made our own customization on it).

`./bibtex.bib` and `strings-full.bib` contains the bibliography data for the project. We also want to thank professor [Wojciech Jarosz](https://cs.dartmouth.edu/~wjarosz/) for his excellent [rendering-bib](https://github.com/wkjarosz/rendering-bib) and [hdrview](https://github.com/wkjarosz/hdrview), which make the documentation and development a lot smoother.

## A Brief Introduction

Photon is a rendering engine made out of my personal interest in computer graphics. A rendering engine is what takes geometrical descriptions and material properties of a 3-D scene as input, and outputs a 2-D image of that scene from a specific point of view. In layman's terms, it is like taking a photograph, except the scene and the camera are both simulated by a computer. This project is actively being developed and more features are expected to come.

**Supported Platforms**: Windows, Linux, macOS *(currently Linux & macOS are not thoroughly tested)*

## Scene Description Language

The scene description language designed by T.C. Chang can be stored into a text file (.p2 filename extension) and loaded by Photon renderer. To create a scene, you can either open up a text file and start writing right away (visit [./scenes/](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/tree/master/scenes) for reference), or install the Blender add-on in [./BlenderAddon/](https://github.com/TzuChieh/Photon-v2/tree/master/BlenderAddon) which contains a separate readme with further details.
